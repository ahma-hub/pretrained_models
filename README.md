# pretrained_models_prerelease
The current repository contains all the pretrained models for each scenario and each Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

## Scenarios
 - Binary Classification
 - Novelty Classification
 - Packer Detection
 - Virtualization Detection
 - Family Classification
 - Obfuscation Classification
 - Type Classification

## Machine Learning Algorithms
 - Na√Øve Bayesian (NB): 
	- 7 models
 - Support Vector Machines (SVM): 
 	- 7 models
 - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): 
	- 7 models 
	- 7 sets of traces that contains the transformed trained traces

## Deep Learning Algorithms
 - Convolutional Neural Nectwork (CNN):
	- 7 models (compressed with 7z)
	- need to be uncompressed before usable with other moduls, run_decompression.sh decompresses files using 7z
 - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):
	- 7 models (compressed with 7z)
	- need to be uncompressed before usable with other moduls, run_decompression.sh decompresses files using 7z
